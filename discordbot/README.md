# DISCORDBOT
## random discord bot project I made for fun before I took any CS classes.

basic functionality:
- respond to discord messages that mention it with certain key words
- "hug" ðŸ¤— or "stab" random users (sends a gif with a hug or an anime fight)
- stayed active using UptimeRobot, a free web service
